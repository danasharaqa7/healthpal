HealthPal is a comprehensive backend API for a digital healthcare platform designed to provide Palestinians with critical access to medical support, remote consultations, medicine coordination, and donation-driven treatment sponsorships. This platform acts as a vital bridge connecting patients, doctors, donors, and medical NGOs to help overcome the challenges posed by local healthcare system inaccessibility or collapse.


This project is being developed as the Course Project for Advanced Software Engineering (Fall 2025), focusing on developing robust, well-documented, and scalable API services
